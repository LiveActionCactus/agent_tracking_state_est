Roadmap:

Main goal:
	1) need to properly develop a library of functionality that users can call on to craft their own simulations... 

Devloping different motion models
	1) probabilistic velocity-based model
	2) probabilistic odometery-based model
	3) deterministic velocity-based model

Developing multi-agent whole-state estimation techniques
	1) kalman filter
	2) particle filter

Developing interesting maps for the agents to move on
	1) vector potential fields

Developing path-planning techniques on maps
